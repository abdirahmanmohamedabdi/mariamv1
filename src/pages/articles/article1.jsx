      How Long It Takes
      </h2>
      <p className="font-abc mb-4">
      Engagement photo sessions typically take at least two hours to allow for at least one outfit change and to build rapport with your photographer. You may also want to change locations during your session, which can take additional time.
It's important to give yourself enough time for your engagement photo session so that you don't feel rushed or stressed. When you're relaxed and comfortable, your photos will reflect that

      What to Wear


      </h2>
      <p className="font-abc mb-4">
      Choosing the right outfits for your engagement photo session can be tricky. Here are some factors to keep in mind when deciding what to wear:


      </p>
        <ul className="font-abc mb-4">
          <li className="font-abc mb-4">
          Formal vs. Informal: It's a good idea to bring at least one formal outfit and one informal outfit to your engagement photo session. Your formal outfit can be something dressy like a suit or a cocktail dress, while your informal outfit can be something more casual and comfortable like jeans and a sweater.

          </li>
          <li className="font-abc mb-4">
          Colors and Patterns: When choosing your outfits, consider the colors and patterns that will look best on camera. Solid colors are a safe bet, but don't be afraid to add a pop of color or a subtle pattern to add interest to your photos.


          </li>
          <li className="font-abc mb-4">
          Comfort: It's important to choose outfits that you feel comfortable and confident in. You don't want to be fidgeting or adjusting your clothes during your photo session, as this can take away from the overall experience.


          </li>
          <li className="font-abc mb-4">
          Coordination: Consider coordinating your outfits with your partner to create a cohesive look. You don't need to match exactly, but choosing complementary colors and styles can help your photos look more polished.
