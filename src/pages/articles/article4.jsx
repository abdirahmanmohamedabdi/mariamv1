          DON’T REGRET YOUR WEDDING PHOTOS
        </h1>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
          Your wedding day is one of the most important days of your life, and
          you want to make sure that every moment is captured perfectly.
          Unfortunately, there are some common mistakes that can lead to wedding
          photo regrets. Here are the top four biggest regrets I’ve heard
          couples express about their wedding photos:

            No Photos of the Special Moments of the Day
          </h2>
          <p className="font-abc mb-4">
            One of the biggest regrets couples have about their wedding photos
            is not having enough photos of the special moments of the day. This
            can include the first look, the first dance, the exchange of vows,
            and other important moments. To avoid this regret, make sure to
            communicate with your photographer ahead of time about the specific
            moments you want to be captured.

        Unflattering Poses

        </h2>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
        Another regret couples have is unflattering poses. It's important to work with a photographer who is experienced in posing and can guide you to pose in a way that flatters your body. Be sure to communicate any insecurities you have with your photographer so they can work with you to create poses that make you feel comfortable and confident.

          Harsh Unnatural Editing


        </h2>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
        While editing can enhance the overall look of your photos, couples often regret harsh and unnatural editing. This can include overly saturated colors, heavy-handed retouching, and other editing techniques that make the photos look less natural. To avoid this regret, make sure to discuss the editing style with your photographer before the wedding day.

        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
        Lastly, couples often regret late delivery of their wedding photos. Waiting too long for your photos can be frustrating and take away from the excitement and memories of your wedding day. Make sure to discuss a timeline for photo delivery with your photographer and get it in writing to avoid any miscommunication.

        </p>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
