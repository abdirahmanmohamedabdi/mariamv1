      <div className="my-12">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-abc font-bold mb-4">
        What is your photography style?


        </h2>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
        Photographers have different styles of photography, ranging from traditional and classic to more modern and creative. Understanding the photographer's style can give you an idea of the type of images you can expect to receive. It's important to choose a photographer whose style aligns with your personal taste and preferences.


        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-abc font-bold mb-4">
        How many weddings have you photographed?



        </h2>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
        Experience matters, and it's important to choose a photographer who has experience shooting weddings. A seasoned photographer will have a wealth of knowledge and experience, and will be better equipped to handle any unexpected situations that may arise.


        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-abc font-bold mb-4">
        What packages do you offer?




        </h2>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
        Most photographers offer different wedding photography packages to fit different budgets and needs. Be sure to ask about what's included in each package, such as the number of hours of coverage, the number of photographers, and the type of prints or albums that are included. It's also important to ask about any additional fees or charges that may apply.



        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-abc font-bold mb-4">
        What is your availability?




        </h2>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
        Wedding photographers often book up quickly, so it's important to find out if the photographer you're interested in is available on your wedding date. If not, they may be able to recommend other photographers who are available on your date.

        </h2>
        <p className="font-abc mb-4">
        It's important to know how long it will take to receive your wedding photos. Some photographers take longer than others to deliver the final images, and it's important to have a realistic expectation of when you can expect to receive them.
