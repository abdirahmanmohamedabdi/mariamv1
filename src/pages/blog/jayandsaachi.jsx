            Hampstead Pergola is one of the most romantic spots in London, known
            for its breathtaking views and stunning architecture. On a beautiful
            summer day in July 2022, Jay surprised Saachi with a proposal that
            she will never forget. This is the story of their love and how Jay
            pulled off the perfect surprise proposal.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg  font-abc text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Jay and Saachi had been dating for a few years, and Jay knew that he
            wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. Because Jay lives
            outside England, he recruited the help of Lisa of<span className="text-brown font-bold "><Link href="https://llproposals.com/" target="_blank">  L&LProposals</Link></span>  to
            help pull it off. Lisa knew that Hampstead Pergola with its
            beautiful gardens & architecture was the perfect spot to pop the
            question. On the day of the proposal, Jay convinced Saachi to go on
            a date that included a stroll through the beautiful gardens at
            Hampstead Pergola. As they walked through the stunning archways,
            they came to an enclosure that had framed photos of their time
            together through the years. With romantic music playing in the
            background, Jay got down on one knee and asked Saachi to marry him.
            Saachi -completely surprised and overwhelmed with emotion- of course
            said yes! I was hidden in an adjacent pathway in the gardens ready
            to capture the special moment and the photos turned out so
            beautiful. They captured the love and joy that Jay and Saachi shared
            in that moment, and they will be treasured forever. After the
            proposal, Jay and Saachi celebrated with champagne and a few more
            photos of the couple as they basked in their time together. They
            spent the rest of the day exploring Hampstead Pergola and enjoying
            each other's company.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-abc text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Jay and Saachi's proposal at Hampstead Pergola was a beautiful and
            romantic moment that they will never forget. The stunning location
            provided the perfect backdrop for their beautiful proposal, and the
            photos captured the magic of the moment perfectly. If you're looking

            Pergola should definitely be on your list. It's a truly magical
